"""Shared scaffold for the PreToolUse guard hooks (commit/pr/shell-content-
write/package-manager/flutter-workdir guards).

Only extracts pieces verified byte-identical across the guards. `deny()`
takes an optional suffix so shell-content-write-guard's extra "use Write
instead" tail is representable without duplicating the function.

Callers import this via a loud try/except (see any guard's top few lines):
a broken/missing _hooklib must block hard, not let every guard go quiet.
